      description: "Once played tambourine for Darren Hanlon... uninvited.",
      bio: "Spent an entire summer on tour trying to convince Darren Hanlon to form a folk supergroup called ‘Harmonica Caravan.’ Their pitch included detailed merch ideas, a concept album about minor inconveniences, and a plan for a world tour exclusively via bicycle. Darren said he’d 'think about it,' which in musician terms means ‘absolutely not,’ but Artist 1 remains hopeful to this day.",

      description: "Claims to have ghostwritten 'Falling Aeroplanes.'",
      bio: "Has spent years arguing that Darren Hanlon’s lyrics are actually secret instructions for an elaborate treasure hunt spanning small-town Australia. They’ve personally visited every location mentioned in his songs, digging in random spots and asking bewildered locals for ‘The Folk Singer’s Secret Map.’ So far, all they’ve found is an old bus timetable and a deep sense of existential dread, but they remain convinced they’re onto something big.",

      description: "Accidentally called Darren Hanlon 'Dan Harmon' once. Still mortified.",
      bio: "Wrote a folk song about Darren Hanlon writing a folk song about them. It started out as a joke but quickly spiraled into an existential crisis about self-referential art. The song is now 12 minutes long, features three key changes, and ends with a recording of them whispering ‘Darren, please acknowledge me’ into an old cassette recorder. The jury’s out on whether it’s genius or a cry for help.",

      description: "Owns a rare bootleg of Darren Hanlon sneezing in E minor.",
      bio: "Was kicked out of a Darren Hanlon gig for shouting 'Play the hits!' even though every song was technically a hit in their heart. Later tried to redeem themselves by organizing the first-ever ‘Darren Hanlon Themed Escape Room,’ where participants had to solve puzzles based on obscure lyrics and find their way out of a replica of a small-town laundromat. The project was sadly abandoned after too many people got distracted making tea and reminiscing about past relationships instead of escaping.",
