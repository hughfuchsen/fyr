    name: "Ruth Parker",
    image: "/ruthParker.jpg",
    bio: `Ruth Parker is a gifted folk musician whose journey into songwriting began later in life, proving that creativity is age-independent. Starting her musical career while living in an isolated fishing village in Western Australia, Ruth began writing the first songs that would eventually lead her to creating a full length record. It wasn’t until her move to Melbourne that she truly found her voice, crafting stories and melodies that resonate deeply with the human experience.\n\n 
    In 2019, in her early 60s, Ruth released her debut album Cul De Sac. This gave listeners a first taste of her music, both deeply confessional and evocative. Ruth’s latest album, Otherwise Occupied, promises to be a significant contribution to the Australian folk music scene. Written during the challenging months of Melbourne’s lockdowns, the album is an introspective journey that delves into themes of loss and the solace she found in songwriting.`,

    name: "The Grand Magoozi",
    image: "/susie3.JPG",
    bio: `Like a seductive David Lynch chanteuse, The Grand Magoozi occupies the stage in a dreamy twilight world. Susie Scurry’s smoky vocals deliver lament and subtle wit in equal measure, pondering a modern world gone awry.\n\n
    Drawing on formative influences that take in Appalachian string-band music and the canon of Roy Orbison, Scurry calls from a time of burnished musical purity. Infused with both dark space and languor, her songs also honour the likes of Patsy Cline, Karen Dalton and Billy Holiday. The Grand Magoozi is a voice in the lonesome night demanding an earnest and endearing ear, imploring us to see through the haze and make simpler sense of today’s world.`,
