    bio: `Shelley Short is an American singer-songwriter known for her evocative blend of folk, alt-country, and acoustic music. Rooted in Portland, Oregon, she draws deep inspiration from landscapes like the desert, mountains, and especially the Oregon coast.
    \n\n
    Short’s music is marked by a warm, vulnerable voice, with lyrics that explore love, grief, resilience, and self-discovery. She blends classic folk traditions with modern textures, enriched by subtle instrumentation like pump organ and lap steel. As one bio puts it, she "transports listeners to the American heartland by conjuring up vivid images of love, grief, and the human experience”`,

    name: "Ruth Parker",
    image: "/ruthParker.jpg",
    bio: `Ruth Parker is a gifted folk musician whose journey into songwriting began later in life, proving that creativity is age-independent. Starting her musical career while living in an isolated fishing village in Western Australia, Ruth began writing the first songs that would eventually lead her to creating a full length record. It wasn’t until her move to Melbourne that she truly found her voice, crafting stories and melodies that resonate deeply with the human experience.\n\n 
    In 2019, in her early 60s, Ruth released her debut album Cul De Sac. This gave listeners a first taste of her music, both deeply confessional and evocative. Ruth’s latest album, Otherwise Occupied, promises to be a significant contribution to the Australian folk music scene. Written during the challenging months of Melbourne’s lockdowns, the album is an introspective journey that delves into themes of loss and the solace she found in songwriting.`,

    name: "Kangaroos With Machine Guns",
    image: "/kwmg.jpg",
    bio: `Kangaroos with machine guns is a band that does not rehearse or write set lists. They believe that music is the union between the personal internal world and the mystical. They are driven by the glittering glistening moment of creation. Many of the songs on this new record are performed by the band for the very first time. They are not perfect but there is a freshness and vibrancy akin to a lightning strike, or a first or last breath.
    \n\n
    They are a bi-coastal set up, sometimes in Boorloo, sometimes all over Australia. Fronted by celestial bagman Archer, with Luke Dux on his electrafried guitar , Ryan Dux on the Bull Fiddle and Todd Pickett bangin stuff withim heart.
    \n\n
    “We’d done a WA tour together backing Archer in halls, old peoples homes, and sometimes even guerrilla style at traffic lights in Midland. We thought we should document what we had done, so we booked a studio” - Luke Dux
    \n\n
    Most of the songs, they had never heard before - each song beginning with Archer’s words and poetry and the music would follow. The synergy of the brothers Dux & Pickett gives heavy space to the romantic and optimistic prose of Archer.`,

    name: "The Grand Magoozi",
    image: "/susie3.JPG",
    bio: `Like a seductive David Lynch chanteuse, The Grand Magoozi occupies the stage in a dreamy twilight world. Susie Scurry’s smoky vocals deliver lament and subtle wit in equal measure, pondering a modern world gone awry.\n\n
    Drawing on formative influences that take in Appalachian string-band music and the canon of Roy Orbison, Scurry calls from a time of burnished musical purity. Infused with both dark space and languor, her songs also honour the likes of Patsy Cline, Karen Dalton and Billy Holiday. The Grand Magoozi is a voice in the lonesome night demanding an earnest and endearing ear, imploring us to see through the haze and make simpler sense of today’s world.`,

    name: "Anthonie Tonnon",
    image: "/anthonie.jpg",
    bio: `Anthonie Tonnon is a distinctive New Zealand singer‑songwriter known for blending indie-pop, synth experiments, and socio-political storytelling that bridges personal emotion and public life. His evolving sound—from folk/indie beginnings to synth-driven art-pop—is matched by a steadfast engagement with community, infrastructure, and environment. He’s as much a creative civic voice as a musician.
    \n\n
    He is a passionate public transport advocate and now, operator of Whanganui’s Durie Hill Elevator.
    \n\n
    In recent years, his work has focused on the immersive live shows, A Synthesized Universe and Rail Land. His last album 'Leave Love Out Of This' won the Taste Music Prize in 2022.`,
