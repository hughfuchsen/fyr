    name: "Darren Hanlon",
    images: ["/darren.jpg"],
    bio: `The Darren Hanlon universe can be summed up in two words: human connection. He has built a self-sustaining career via his catalog of songs alone. His shows are built around his narrative songwriting and storytelling, and his intimate connection with the audience.
    \n\n
    He has recorded many albums and spent years traveling the far-flung corners of the world on his own terms. He doesn’t chase trends. In fact, he seems delightfully allergic to them. He still tours solo or with a rotating cast of musical friends, playing in churches, lounge rooms, and tiny halls where every lyric lands like it was written just for you. And while most artists slow down over time, Hanlon ages like your favourite pair of jeans—worn in all the right places, getting more comfortable, honest, and quietly brilliant with every year.`,

    bio: `Shelley Short is an American singer-songwriter known for her evocative blend of folk, alt-country, and acoustic music. Rooted in Portland, Oregon, she draws deep inspiration from landscapes like the desert, mountains, and especially the Oregon coast.
    \n\n
    Short’s music is marked by a warm, vulnerable voice, with lyrics that explore love, grief, resilience, and self-discovery. She blends classic folk traditions with modern textures, enriched by subtle instrumentation like pump organ and lap steel. As one bio puts it, she "transports listeners to the American heartland by conjuring up vivid images of love, grief, and the human experience”`,

    bio: `Kankawa Nagarra is a Walmatjarri Elder, teacher and mentor, human rights advocate, and a passionate environmental activist. Born in the traditional lands of the Gooniyandi and Walmatjarri peoples of north western Australia Her journey—from mission life to AMP winner—is a powerful testament to resilience, creativity, and cultural stewardship.
    \n\n
    Kankawa spent her childhood listening to the tribal songs at cultural ceremonies, and when she was taken from her family to the mission she was taught hymns and Gospel songs with the choir. On the pastoral lease where she was sent to work Country Music was everywhere and she heard Rock and Roll for the first time on the station gramophone.
    \n\n
    But it wasn’t until many years later her musical journey truly began when she stopped to listen to a busker outside a shop in Derby, WA. It was the first time she’d heard the Blues and it awakened something in her. Through it she found a medium to express all her thoughts and feelings and it inspired her to turn these into songs. The empathy of her message extends from those she sees struggling around her to the entire planet being ravaged for profit.`,

    name: "Ruth Parker",
    images: ["/ruthParker.jpg","/darren.jpg"],
    bio: `Ruth Parker is a gifted folk musician whose journey into songwriting began later in life, proving that creativity is age-independent. Starting her musical career while living in an isolated fishing village in Western Australia, Ruth began writing the first songs that would eventually lead her to creating a full length record. It wasn’t until her move to Melbourne that she truly found her voice, crafting stories and melodies that resonate deeply with the human experience.\n\n 
    In 2019, in her early 60s, Ruth released her debut album Cul De Sac. This gave listeners a first taste of her music, both deeply confessional and evocative. Ruth’s latest album, Otherwise Occupied, promises to be a significant contribution to the Australian folk music scene. Written during the challenging months of Melbourne’s lockdowns, the album is an introspective journey that delves into themes of loss and the solace she found in songwriting.`,

    name: "Kangaroos With Machine Guns",
    images: ["/kwmg.jpg"],
    bio: `Kangaroos with machine guns is a band that does not rehearse or write set lists. They believe that music is the union between the personal internal world and the mystical. They are driven by the glittering glistening moment of creation. Many of the songs on this new record are performed by the band for the very first time. They are not perfect but there is a freshness and vibrancy akin to a lightning strike, or a first or last breath.
    \n\n
    They are a bi-coastal set up, sometimes in Boorloo, sometimes all over Australia. Fronted by celestial bagman Archer, with Luke Dux on his electrafried guitar , Ryan Dux on the Bull Fiddle and Todd Pickett bangin stuff withim heart.
    \n\n
    “We’d done a WA tour together backing Archer in halls, old peoples homes, and sometimes even guerrilla style at traffic lights in Midland. We thought we should document what we had done, so we booked a studio” - Luke Dux
    \n\n
    Most of the songs, they had never heard before - each song beginning with Archer’s words and poetry and the music would follow. The synergy of the brothers Dux & Pickett gives heavy space to the romantic and optimistic prose of Archer.`,

    name: "The Grand Magoozi",
    images: ["/susie3.JPG"],
    bio: `Like a seductive David Lynch chanteuse, The Grand Magoozi occupies the stage in a dreamy twilight world. Susie Scurry’s smoky vocals deliver lament and subtle wit in equal measure, pondering a modern world gone awry.\n\n
    Drawing on formative influences that take in Appalachian string-band music and the canon of Roy Orbison, Scurry calls from a time of burnished musical purity. Infused with both dark space and languor, her songs also honour the likes of Patsy Cline, Karen Dalton and Billy Holiday. The Grand Magoozi is a voice in the lonesome night demanding an earnest and endearing ear, imploring us to see through the haze and make simpler sense of today’s world.`,
